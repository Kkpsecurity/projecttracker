Last message to Saunders:\r\n-------------------\r\nRegarding costs, for private groups with a hosted venue site, pricing is based on $12,000 per course (5-days\/40-hours) plus expenses. If it was International, there would be an added fee for travel time but not relevant with a short trip to GA. I can accommodate up to 25 students in an ATO course. \r\n\r\nSo if it were contracted, we\u2019d estimate the expenses and provide an inclusive rate (probably somewhere around $15,000 including expenses for GA). If the arrangement was to price for individual tuition, we would probably suggest a pricing model at $1,500 per student and a 10 student minimum. If the host is confident they can deliver a larger audience, that price can be lowered. In the end, what matters is that we arrive at a minimum of $15,000 gross for the course.\r\n\r\nFor organizations that want to host multiple sessions, we adjust that pricing according to scale. For example, Amazon recently requested a series of six sessions and we adjusted the base price to $11,000 per week (excluding expenses).",
