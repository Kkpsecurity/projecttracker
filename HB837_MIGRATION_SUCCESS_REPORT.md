## 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Database Configuration
```ini
# .env.testing
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=criustemp.hq.cisadmin.com
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=pt_test
DB_USERNAME=rclark
DB_PASSWORD=Tmaster$101
```

### Three-Phase Import Workflow
1. **Phase 1 (Initial):** Create new HB837 records from Excel/CSV
2. **Phase 2 (Update):** Update existing records with additional data  
3. **Phase 3 (Review):** Final adjustments and validation

### Controller Endpoints
- `POST /admin/hb837/import` - Single phase import
- `POST /admin/hb837/executeThreePhaseImport` - Batch import
- `POST /admin/hb837/import/compare` - Preview changes
