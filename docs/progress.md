# HB837 Backup/Import/Export System Progress Report

**Date:** 2025-06-24

## Recent Progress

- **Import Title Generation:**
  - The `import` method in `BackupDBController.php` now supports an optional `import_title` field. If not provided, it auto-generates a title using the current date and the first address found in the uploaded file (CSV/XLSX). This title is stored in the `ImportAudit` record and included in logs.

- **UI/UX:**
  - The import modal allows users to enter an import title or leave it blank for auto-generation.
  - Debug/admin-only features are visible only to authorized users (user ID 1).

- **Database Structure Documentation:**
  - A Markdown report exists in `docs/database_structure_report.md`.

- **Field Mapping:**
  - All HB837 fields are confirmed to be included in import/export logic.

- **Backup/Import/Export Validation:**
  - Validation is in place for file type, size, and required fields.
  - Truncate option is restricted to admin users.

- **Logging & Auditing:**
  - All import/export/backup actions are logged and audited, including file details and user actions.

## Next Steps / Pending

- **ZIP Code Validation:**
  - Update to support ZIP+4 and alphanumeric postal codes if required.

- **Optional:**
  - Further UI/UX improvements as requested.
  - Additional automation or validation enhancements.
