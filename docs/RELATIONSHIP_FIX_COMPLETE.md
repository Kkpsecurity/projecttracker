# Relationship Fix Report - Complete

## Issue Fixed
**Error:** `Call to undefined relationship [plotAddress] on model [App\Models\Plot]`

## Root Cause
The Plot model was using `address()` relationship but the views and some controller code were still referencing the old `plotAddress` relationship name.

## Files Fixed

### 1. View Files
- `resources/views/admin/plots/show.blade.php`
  - Changed `$plot->plotAddress` to `$plot->address` (multiple instances)
  - Updated both address display sections

- `resources/views/admin/plots/edit.blade.php` 
  - Updated all form field values from `$plot->plotAddress->field` to `$plot->address->field`
  - Fixed fields: address_line_1, address_line_2, city, state, zip_code, country

### 2. Controller Files
- `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/GoogleMapsController.php`
  - Fixed `->with(['plotAddress', 'hb837'])` to `->with(['address', 'hb837'])`

## Verification Results
✅ All URLs now load successfully:
- `/admin/maps` - Google Maps page (was failing before)
- `/admin/plots` - Plots management page  
- `/admin/hb837` - HB837 projects page

## Technical Details
- The Plot model correctly defines `address()` relationship via `hasOne(PlotAddress::class)`
- The PlotAddress model correctly defines `plot()` relationship via `belongsTo(Plot::class)`
- All view references now use the correct `$plot->address` syntax
- Controller eager loading now uses correct relationship name

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED
The plotAddress relationship error has been completely fixed. All frontend pages should now work correctly without relationship errors.

## Next Steps
1. Manual testing of plot creation/editing forms
2. Verification of Google Maps functionality
3. Testing of address data display and updates
4. Optional: Further UI/UX improvements
