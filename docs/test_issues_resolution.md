# Test Issues Resolution Summary

## Current Status: June 24, 2025

### ✅ Issues Resolved:
1. **DatabaseBackUp Class Namespace**: Fixed namespace from `App\Console` to `App\Console\Commands`
2. **Laravel Bootstrap**: Confirmed Laravel application bootstrap works correctly
3. **Class Loading**: No duplicate class declarations found
4. **Config Cache**: Rebuilt config cache successfully

### ❌ Remaining Issues:

#### 1. Missing PHPUnit Installation
- `vendor\bin\phpunit` doesn't exist
- `vendor\phpunit\phpunit` directory is empty
- Need to complete composer installation

#### 2. Missing facade/ignition Package
- Error: `Class 'Facade\Ignition\IgnitionServiceProvider' not found`
- Package is listed in composer.json but may not be fully installed

#### 3. Composer Installation In Progress
- `composer install` was running when last checked
- PHPUnit and other dev dependencies may still be installing

#### 4. **NEW: Storage Logs Permission Error** 🚨
- Error: `There is no existing directory at "T:\projecttracker\storage\logs" and it could not be created: Permission denied`
- HTTP 500 Internal Server Error due to logging failure
- **Root Cause**: Network mapped drive setup - Windows client editing files on Linux server
  - Files are on `T:\projecttracker` (Windows mapped drive)
  - Web server runs on `/var/www/projecttracker/` (Linux server)
  - Linux web server (www-data) lacks write permissions to storage directory
- **Solution**: Run `fix_permissions.sh` script on the Linux server

### 🔄 Current Actions:
- Composer is installing development dependencies
- facade/ignition installation was initiated
- Waiting for installations to complete

### 📋 Next Steps:
1. Wait for composer installations to complete
2. Verify PHPUnit is properly installed in vendor/bin/
3. Test basic Laravel artisan commands
4. Run simplified tests that don't require database
5. Configure proper test database for full feature tests

### 🧪 Test Files Status:
- ✅ `tests/Feature/BasicRoutesTest.php` - Ready (no DB required)
- ✅ `tests/Feature/LoginTest.php` - Ready (minimal DB requirements)  
- ❌ `tests/Feature/ImportTest.php` - Requires full DB setup
- ✅ `tests/Feature/SimpleTest.php` - Created for basic testing

### 💾 Database Test Issues:
- Test database `projecttracker_test` may not exist
- MySQL connection for testing not verified
- Consider using SQLite for simpler test setup

## Recommended Actions:
1. **IMMEDIATE**: SSH to the Linux server and run the permissions fix:
   ```bash
   ssh [username]@[server-ip]
   cd /var/www/projecttracker
   chmod +x fix_permissions.sh
   ./fix_permissions.sh
   ```
2. Complete current composer installations
3. Verify all required packages are installed
4. Set up proper test database configuration
5. Run tests in order of complexity (simple → routes → database-dependent)

## Environment Setup:
- **Client**: Windows machine editing via mapped drive `T:\projecttracker`
- **Server**: Linux server running web server at `/var/www/projecttracker/`
- **Issue**: Permission mismatch between Windows file access and Linux web server
