- Uses Bootstrap 4 nav-tabs with proper ARIA accessibility
- Each tab contains relevant grouped fields

### 2. Form Layout Structure

#### General Tab (Left Column):
- Property Name (top priority)
- Address
- City/County (side by side)
- State/ZIP (side by side)
- Units
- Notes

#### General Tab (Right Column):
- Macro Client
- Macro Client Email
- Management Company (moved per email)
- Date of Scheduled Inspection (new per email)
- Report Status
- Assigned Consultant (simplified per email)

#### Contacts Tab:

### 3. Backend Updates

#### Model Changes:
- Updated `app/Models/HB837.php` casts from 'date' to 'datetime' for proper formatting
- All required fields already in fillable array

#### Controller Updates:
- Added `financial_notes` validation in `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/HB837/HB837Controller.php`
- Updated validation rules to handle all new fields
- Maintains existing functionality for all tabs

### 4. Data Type Handling
- Date fields: Use `->format('Y-m-d')` for HTML date inputs
