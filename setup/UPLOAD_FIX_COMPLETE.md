## 🎉 Excel Import Issue Resolution - COMPLETE

### ✅ **Issue Fixed**: "Failed to store uploaded file at: ..."

The file upload failure has been completely resolved with enhanced error handling and robust directory management.

---

### 🔧 **Root Causes Identified & Fixed:**

1. **🚨 Missing Directory Structure**
   - Created `storage/app/temp/` and `storage/app/temp/imports/` directories
   - Added proper `.gitkeep` files to preserve structure

2. **🚨 Inadequate Error Handling** 
   - Enhanced file upload logic with comprehensive error checking
   - Added directory creation with proper permissions (0755)
   - Improved file existence and readability verification

3. **🚨 Path Handling Issues**
   - Fixed mixed path separators (Windows vs Linux)
   - Added path normalization for cross-platform compatibility
   - Enhanced Laravel Storage integration

    }
}

// ✅ Comprehensive File Verification

Log::info("File uploaded successfully", [
